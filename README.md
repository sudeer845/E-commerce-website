<p align="justify">I developed a full‑stack E‑commerce web application using Django as the backend framework to manage business logic and database operations. The frontend was crafted with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring a responsive design and smooth user experience across devices. Key features include a product catalog, shopping cart, wishlist, and user authentication, delivering a complete and interactive online shopping platform.</p>
